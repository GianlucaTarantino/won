# WON
## Web Object Notation

## What is WON? Why does it exists?
Won is a multi purpose HTML to JSON (and vice-versa) converting tool. It is very useful for various applications in the field of web development, for example it helps a lot in web pages parsing and modification in some tedious languages like C, because all you have to do is use an easy JSON.
I made WON because recently, while making a web scraping project with C++, I noticed that in languages like this is very difficult to get a code (and human) friendly representation of an HTML page.
### How is it made?
It is currently made in Node.JS, using [htmlparser2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlparser2) (go check their [repo](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2), this is an awesome Node Package) because this was the fastest implementation for HTML parsing on the NPM scenario.
###
(For the CSS Parsing I was struggling a bit, then I found an [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5240778/css-to-json-parser-or-converter/60451920#60451920) on Stack Overflow with a pretty decent already made algorithm for CSS parsing, so I said "Why not?". I just increased the readability of the code, but the algorithm is took from that answer.)
### How does it works?
It is currently just a CLI utility. A JS library for in-code convertions of HTML strings to JSON (and vice-versa) is currently under development. Alongside the JS version, other languages binding will be developed.
Using `won -hj pathToFile.html` you will get a JSON output file, structured like a valid WON Object. Using `won -jh pathToFile.json` you will get a HTML file. Same for CSS, but use a `c` instead of the `h` (example: `won -cj pathToFile.css`). Add `-o outputName.o` to determine a name for the output file.

## How to install
Currently, is supported just a manual installation, but an installation via NPM will be ready soon, so don't worry.
1. In terminal, write `git clone https://github.com/GianlucaTarantino/won.git` (or just download the repo)
2. Go to the repository directory
3. In terminal, write `sudo npm link` 

Now you can use WON as described before!
